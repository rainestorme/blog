# Introducing cedr - the ChromeOS Enrolled Desktop Runtime

cedr is a powerful tool designed to run chroots with desktop environments through `crouton` on enrolled ChromeOS device, bypassing the `noexec` mount with a USB drive or SD card. cedr only automates the processes shown in my previous blog post, providing an easy way to create and use drives loaded with chroots.
